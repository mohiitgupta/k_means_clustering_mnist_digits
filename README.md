The code has been written using python 3. This code has implementation for kmeans algorithm and hierarchical/agglomerative clustering using scipy library. The kmeans code is present in `kmeans.py`.

Note, that the definition of SC used is as per the lecture notes of CS573 by Prof. Ming Yin. This definition is different from the definition of SC as given in wikipedia. Using the definition taught in the lecture, the plot for WC-SSD is an elbow curve but the plot for SC is a monotonically increasing curve as can be seen in report `CS573_HW5.pdf`.

The code for analysis for kmeans is present in `kmeans_analysis.py`.
The code for plotting dendograms, curves and analysis for hierarchical clustering is in `hierarchical.py`.

Happy Coding!
